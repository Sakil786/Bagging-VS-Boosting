## Bagging VS Boosting
* In esemble learning, we combine two or more models to build a more accurate Model.
* Boosting and Bagging are the two approaches used on ensemble learning.


|  Scenario |  Bagging |  Boosting |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Data Partition |In Bagging ,data partition is random.   | In boosting , mis-classfied data is given higher importance.  |
| Goal |In Bagging ,the goal is to reduce the variance in Model.  | In boosting ,the goal is to increase the prediction accuracy of the model. |
| Method |In Bagging ,we use random subspace. | In boosting ,we use gradient descent method. |
